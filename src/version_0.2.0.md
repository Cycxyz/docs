# Version 0.2.0

**Status:** Deployed as an upgrade but never used in production; superseded by hotfix.

Version 0.2.0 was released in response to the Discord scam attack (13 Feb). It introduces the function `executeSpecificTransfer`, which allows governance to transfer funds from the attacker's account.
