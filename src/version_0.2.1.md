# Version 0.2.1

**Status:** Deployed as an upgrade and used for governance; subsequently rolled back to [0.1.12](./version_0.1.12.md).

Version 0.2.1 was released in response to the Discord scam attack (13 Feb). It hotfixes the function `executeSpecificTransfer`, which allows governance to transfer funds from the attacker's account.
